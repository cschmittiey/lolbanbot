# lolbanbot

this was inspired by a stupid meme i saw on the internet about automatically banning people from a discord server for playing league of legends.

## how to use?

- docker-compose build
- edit your docker compose file to add the bot token. i don't really know for sure what intents it needs but i gave it the ones that seemed to make sense.
- docker-compose up -d
