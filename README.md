# lolbanbot

this was inspired by a stupid meme i saw on the internet about [automatically banning people from a discord server for playing league of legends.](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/628997127984644146/1069379638301831259/image.png)



as a fun note, most of this was written by asking chatgpt how to do it, and then making it work. initially they tried to tell me that banning people for playing league was unethical, but i disagree :^)

## how to use?

- docker-compose build
- edit your docker compose file to add the bot token. i don't really know for sure what intents it needs but i gave it the ones that seemed to make sense.
- docker-compose up -d
